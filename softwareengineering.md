# How to start your jurney as a software engineer

It can be very intimidating at first, It is a whole new world who is speaking so many ununderstandable languages so you get stuck from where you should start.
Do i need to learn a spicific language? or just jump into a crash course on youtube?

I will share with you my experience here. I started first as a UI/UX developer and worked in couple of companies and found that i wont proceed anymore unless i study by myself rather than counting on a job that i will learn through working, Yeah sure when you work you get to implement all what you are learning but you need study ITS IMPORTNANT.

You need to learn the basics and fundimentals so you can after that go and learn anything easly. for instance to learn cooking you learn bascis:
1. spices .. what they taste, smell and effect they have on food.
2. chopping techniques.
3. cooking .. frying, boiling, grilling .. etc.


and so on. 

after that your would be able to cook whatever you want and even your can invent dishes, you simply do learn cooking by copying recipes your need to understand the components or the recipe. Same goes with programming.

I started to look for free resources to study that is organised and containd a curriculum and a roadmap that i can follow. I found this open school for computer science that has amazing curriculum and content from harvard and edx.

I got enrolled in this amazing school program ALX Africa from Holberton school and I am now in the second month. and its a tottally free program yor need to be dedicated to it as its 10 hourse/day study worth.

I have learnt that social presence is very very important you need to be active and contribute to the community share knowledge, share what you learn and contribute to open source community as this will help you to be recognised and be part of this big comminty of developers who help each other and mak an impact.

Sometime its difficult and boring, sometimes its exciting and encouraging but in all cases you need to be determand and pacient. You need to be creative in the way you are learning and not just following steps.
